# Project Title
Automatic Prediction of interfloor noise disturbance
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of fundamental machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels. These algorithms are employed for regression and classification tasks on interfloor sounds, which are the sounds transmitted between the floors of a building. The objective of this model is to predict the perceived disturbance caused by these types of sounds. 

## Details
The work on this project has continued and evolved into a scientific paper to be published in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems. The paper explores the use of deep learning algorithms to accomplish the same tasks.
